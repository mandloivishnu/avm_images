      "passage": "Discipline is the practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behaviour. It is a set of rules and regulations which are to be followed by a group of people. Discipline is necessary in all walks of life. The military, the police and the sports teams, all need discipline. Without it, they cannot achieve their goals. It is of paramount importance in the life of a student. Students without discipline cannot secure good marks in the examination. The most essential requirement for the success of an institution is discipline. It is equally important in the national life. The citizens of a country must have a sense of discipline. Discipline is the soul of democracy. Students should undergo a disciplined life during their academic career. They must respect their teachers and obey them. They should devote most of their time to their studies. Those who have a sense of discipline at an early age are better prepared to face the challenges of life.",

It sings only when it sees one. Its song has the quality of bringing peace of mind to the listener. A passing traveller, once asked the bird why it was singing its heart out. The bird replied that it was looking for an appreciative audience. It further said that most people have no time to listen to a bird's song. In this materialistic world, man is too busy to enjoy the sweet harmony of nature. He is running after the fleeting pleasures of life, not realising that lasting happiness lies in the world of nature. The traveller asked the bird if it would like to move to a city park where it would have a bigger audience. The bird immediately refused saying that the city air was full of noise and smoke. It said it would prefer to live in the peaceful surroundings of the forest and sing for an audience that valued true happiness, peace of mind and natural beauty. The bird continued to sing and the traveller went on his way, listening to the echoing notes that seemed to make the forest more beautiful.",
