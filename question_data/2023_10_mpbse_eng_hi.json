Students who shine in athletics or in games consider that it is better to spend time and energy in a sports arena than in a classroom or at the reading desk. All the same they do not always do well academically. Academic honour has a glamour which is unique. It is not to be denied that playing games is useful activity, because it creates team spirit and also makes the sportsmen healthy and vigorous. That is why games and sports are given so much importance in the curriculum of schools and colleges. But studies should not be neglected and should be given due importance along with other activities connected with education. Let each type of activity have its own place in our daily routine. Then only will we have students both academically sound and physically fit. We want our educational system to generate this synergy among our youth.",

Although games are useful for health, teamwork, and energy, academic success has its own unique honour. Education should give equal importance to both studies and sports. A proper balance in daily routine can help develop students who are mentally sound and physically fit."
