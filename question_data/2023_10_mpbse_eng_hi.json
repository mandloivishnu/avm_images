      "passage": "There once was a stingy baker. A poor man would stand outside his bakery every day, enjoying the nice smell of baking bread. The baker was very angry at the poor man. He felt that anyone who smelled his delicious products should pay for the smell. So he took the poor man to the court.\n\nThe judge heard the baker’s complaint patiently. Then he asked the poor man, “Do you have any money?”\n\nThe poor man searched his pocket and produced two small coins. “This is all the money I have,” he said to the judge.\n\nThe judge took the coins from the poor man. The baker smiled and eagerly held out his hand.\n\nBut the judge did not give the baker the money. He only jingled the coins together. He then returned them to the poor man, saying, “Punishment should fit the crime. The price for the smell of bread shall be the sound of money.”",

It hastened to a neighbouring tree and plucking off a leaf, dropped it into the water before the bee. The bee climbed on to the leaf, dried its wings and flew away to its hive, full of gratitude to the dove that had saved its life.\n\nA few days later the same bee, while returning to its hive after a hard day’s work, saw a cruel boy taking aim at the dove sitting upon the branch of a tree. At once the bee flew to the wrist of the boy, and just when he was going to shoot the dove, stung the boy and made him cry with pain. He was feeling the danger to which the dove was exposed, flew safely away.",

      "passage": "Since time began, the natural broad-leaved mixed forests of the Himalayas have played a crucial role in the life of the people of that region. In fact, the forests are the foundation of the whole economy of the hill villages. Green leaves and grass, for example, provide fodder for the animals whose dung is used as fertilizer. Dry twigs and branches are the only sources of domestic cooking fuel. The forests also provide large supplies of fruits, edible nuts, fibres and herbs for local consumption.\n\nThe forests break the flow of the seasonal rainfall that lashes the slopes of this mountain range every year during the monsoon. This creates springs and perennial streams which are vital for the mountain people and their animals during the hot summer months.\n\nFor many years, however, large areas of these rich forest resources have been destroyed. For example, the forests of Tehri Garhwal were exploited to supply timber for the expanding railway network in the plains. The people of Tehri Garhwal in 1930 began a non-cooperation movement called Satyagraha of peaceful resistance to obtain justice in opposition to the oppressive forest laws.",

      "explanation": "Online education is a modern system of learning in which students study through the internet using computers, mobiles and other digital devices.\n\nIn today’s fast-changing world, online education has become very important. It played a vital role during emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, when schools and colleges were closed. Through online classes, students were able to continue their studies from home. Recorded lectures, digital notes and online tests made learning easy and flexible.\n\nOnline education saves time and money as students do not need to travel. It also provides access to quality education from anywhere. However, it has some drawbacks. Lack of face-to-face interaction, network problems and distraction at home affect learning. Not all students have proper internet facilities.\n\nIn conclusion, online education is a useful support system for traditional education. With proper planning and technology, it can play an important role in the future of education."

      "explanation": "Social media has become a common part of our daily life. People use it for communication, entertainment and sharing information.\n\nHowever, excessive use of social media has many disadvantages. It wastes valuable time, especially of students, and affects their studies. Addiction to social media leads to lack of concentration and poor academic performance. Fake news and rumours spread rapidly, creating fear and misunderstanding in society.\n\nSocial media also causes mental health problems such as stress, anxiety and depression. Cyber crimes like hacking and online bullying are increasing. Personal relationships are affected as people spend more time online than with family members.\n\nIn conclusion, social media should be used carefully and wisely. Limited and responsible use can reduce its harmful effects and help students focus on their goals."

      "explanation": "Population growth means a rapid increase in the number of people in a country.\n\nIn India, population growth is a serious problem. The main causes are lack of education, poverty, early marriage and poor awareness about family planning. Overpopulation creates many problems such as unemployment, shortage of food, housing problems and pressure on natural resources.\n\nIt also leads to pollution, poverty and low standard of living. Government finds it difficult to provide basic facilities like education, health and employment to everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, population growth can be controlled through education, awareness programs and family planning. A small and healthy population is necessary for the development of the nation."

      "explanation": "Electric vehicles are vehicles that run on electricity instead of petrol or diesel.\n\nIn the present time, electric vehicles are very important due to increasing pollution and shortage of fossil fuels. These vehicles do not emit harmful gases and help in reducing air pollution. They are eco-friendly and economical in the long run.\n\nElectric vehicles also help in saving natural resources and reducing dependence on imported fuel. However, challenges like high initial cost and lack of charging stations still exist.\n\nIn conclusion, electric vehicles are the need of the hour. With better infrastructure and government support, they can help create a clean, healthy and pollution-free environment."

      "explanation": "Women empowerment means giving women equal rights, opportunities and freedom in society.\n\nWomen play an important role in the development of a nation. Education of girls is the key to women empowerment. Educated women contribute to economic growth, family welfare and social progress. Gender equality and economic independence help women live with dignity and confidence.\n\nGovernment schemes and social awareness programs are helping women become self-reliant. Still, discrimination and inequality exist in many areas.\n\nIn conclusion, women empowerment is essential for national development. When women progress, the entire nation moves towards growth and prosperity."
