      "passage": "In 1866, Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist, introduced a form of nitroglycerine that could be handled safely. He called it dynamite. In 1875, he went on to invent gelatinite. These explosives were used in engineering application, but they also had an obvious military application. As a committed pacifist, Nobel hoped that his explosives would provide such a deterrent to war that the world would become so militarised and hostile that he would bring about peace. However, he used in his will to endow the Nobel Prizes awarded to those who have contributed to world peace, to advance humanity. In five categories: Physics, Chemistry, Literature and Peace. The Bank of Sweden inaugurated a new Nobel Prize for Economics in 1969. In 1903, Marie Curie became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize, sharing it with her husband.",

Students who shine in athletics or in games consider that it is better to spend time and energy in a sports arena than in a classroom or at the reading desk. All the same they do not always do well academically. Academic honour has a glamour which is unique. It is not to be denied that playing games is useful activity, because it creates team spirit and also makes the sportsmen healthy and vigorous. That is why games and sports are given so much importance in the curriculum of schools and colleges. But studies should not be neglected and should be given due importance along with other activities connected with education. Let each type of activity have its own place in our daily routine. Then only will we have students both academically sound and physically fit. We want our educational system to generate this synergy among our youth.",
