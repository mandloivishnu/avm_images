      "passage": "There, once, was a stingy baker. A poor man would stand outside his bakery every day, enjoying the nice smell of baking bread. The baker was very angry at the poor man. He felt that anyone who smelled his delicious products should pay for the smell. So he took the poor man to the court. The judge heard the baker's complaint patiently. Then he asked the poor man, \"Do you have any money?\" The poor man searched his pocket and produced two small coins. \"This is all the money I have,\" he said to the judge. The judge took the coins from the poor man. The baker smiled and eagerly held out his hand. But the judge did not give the baker the money. He only jingled the coins together and then handed them back to the poor man. \"Justice is served!\" he announced. The poor man thanked the judge and quickly left the court. The baker shouted, \"But what about my money?\" The judge said, \"You were paid for the smell of your bread with the sound of his money.\"",

These explosives were used in engineering application, but they also had an obvious military application. As a committed pacifist, Nobel hoped that his explosives would provide such a deterrent to war that the world would become so militarised and hostile that he would bring about peace. However, he used in his will to endow the Nobel Prizes awarded to those who have contributed to world peace, to advance humanity. The prizes are in five categories: Physics, Chemistry, Literature, Medicine and Peace. The Bank of Sweden inaugurated a new Nobel Prize for Economics in 1969. In 1903, Marie Curie became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize, sharing it with her husband.",

In fact, festivals are an integral part of human life. They mark a pause in the daily monotonous routine. They inspire us to forget our worries and relax. Festivals are important because they play a great role in promoting national integration. They bring all the sections of the society together. Festivals can be religious, social, or national. Religious festivals like Diwali, Holi, and Id are celebrated with great enthusiasm. Social festivals are fairs, tournaments, and exhibitions. National festivals are Independence Day, Republic Day and Gandhi Jayanti. They are celebrated by one and all irrespective of their religion, caste, creed or colour.
