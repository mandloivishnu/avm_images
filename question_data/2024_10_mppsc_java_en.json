    "2 Marks": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?",
        "answer": "HashMap is unordered and faster; TreeMap maintains sorted keys and uses Red-Black tree."

    "5 Marks": [
      {
        "question": "Explain the difference between Collection and Collections class.",
        "answer": "Collection is an interface (List, Set), while Collections is a utility class with static methods like sort(), reverse(), etc."

      {
        "question": "Describe the internal working of HashMap in Java.",
        "answer": "HashMap uses an array of buckets. It stores key-value pairs using hashCode and equals methods. In case of collision, it uses chaining (linked list or tree after Java 8)."
