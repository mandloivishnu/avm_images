      "passage": "Discipline must be enforced early in life. Discipline at home makes for the future greatness of a boy. It forms his character and makes him a fit citizen. The child who is allowed to have his own way becomes way-ward. The child who is allowed all sorts of excesses like running about in the sun, exposing himself to cold, eating wholesome things, as a result will fall ill frequently. A child, whose habits have been disciplined and who has been taught to rise early, attend to his lessons properly, take physical exercises at the proper time and avoid things that are injurious will grow up to be a useful member of the society. The spoilt child who has been allowed to run his own course will show vice in younger days. His parents would wish that he had not been born at all.",

His father was a school teacher. He died when Lal Bahadur was only a year and a half old. His mother, Ramdulari Devi, took him and his two sisters to her father’s house. Lal Bahadur's childhood was spent at his grandfather’s house. As a boy, he was quiet, serious, and thought-ful. He was a great patriot. His greatest moment came in 1965 when Pakistan attacked India. As Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri led the nation to victory. He died at Tashkent on January 11, 1966. He was the first person to be posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna. His term of Prime Ministership may have been short but his contribution to the nation was tremendous. He gave the slogan 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan'.",

You must let me suck your cow's milk for three months. Also, if you do not pay me in time, I will curse your cow.” The old woman was very sad. But she had no other choice. So she agreed. The witch gave the woman a medicine for her cow. The cow recovered. The woman was overjoyed. In her joy, she forgot the condition of the witch. She did not give any milk to the witch for three months. The witch became angry and put a curse on the cow. The cow fell sick again. The old woman took the help of the witch again. She gave a curse-removal medicine to the cow. When the old woman returned home, she saw the cow grazing on the common land. The old woman was a little wiser this time. She decided to keep her promise to the witch.",

          "explanation": "A 'dust of snow' is fine, light particles of snow. The simple action of the crow shaking the snow from the hemlock tree changed his mood. His mood changed from despair/sadness to one of quiet joy and feeling saved for the rest of the day."

          "explanation": "The poet says he would not intrude to avoid interfering with the boy's personal learning experience. He doesn't offer money because the boy must learn to cope with loss and responsibility by himself; money won't replace the lost memory or lesson."

It compelled a law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, changed a family-loving husband into a man without a home, and ultimately drove him to sacrifice his personal comfort for the struggle for the freedom of his people, becoming one of the world's greatest statesmen."

          "explanation": "Maddie stands by and does nothing because she is poor herself and fears that if she speaks up against Peggy's teasing of Wanda, she will become the next target. Maddie is different from Peggy because Peggy teases Wanda out of thoughtlessness, while Maddie is acutely sensitive to Wanda's pain and feels guilty, though her fear keeps her silent."

          "explanation": "Selfishness is usually understood as prioritizing one's own needs over the needs of others. Yes, we agree with Kisa Gotami's realization because, in her grief, she was so focused on her personal sorrow (bringing her son back) that she ignored the universal truth of death and the suffering of everyone else, making her pursuit a 'selfish' one in a spiritual context."

He implies that superficial beauty is what men are attracted to, suggesting only God can love a person purely for their soul, not their external appearance."

          "explanation": "Matilda's ruin was caused by her excessive pride, materialism, and vanity—her desire to appear wealthy by wearing borrowed jewellery. She could have avoided it by being honest: either by simply not borrowing the item, or by telling her friend, Madame Forestier, immediately that she had lost the necklace, instead of replacing it with an expensive, genuine one."

          "explanation": "The question refers to the play 'The Proposal'. The marriage *does* eventually take place, but not peacefully. If the question implies 'Why is the wedding not happening easily?', the reason is the constant, petty, and ridiculous arguments between Lomov and Natalya over minor issues like Oxen Meadows and the superiority of their dogs. Their pride and temperamental natures prevent a smooth agreement."
