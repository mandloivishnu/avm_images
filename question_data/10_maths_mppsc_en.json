      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "5² + 12² = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13², so it's a Pythagorean triplet."

      {
        "question": "Find the value of x if 2x + 5 = 13.",
        "answer": "Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 8; Divide both sides by 2: x = 4."

      {
        "question": "Write the formula for the area of a circle and define each term.",
        "answer": "Area = πr², where r is the radius of the circle and π ≈ 3.14."

      {
        "question": "Solve the quadratic equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0.",
        "answer": "Factor the equation: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0. So, x = 2 or x = 3."

      {
        "question": "Prove that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°.",
        "answer": "Draw a triangle and extend one side. Use alternate angles formed by a parallel line and a transversal. The three angles together form a straight angle, hence 180°."
